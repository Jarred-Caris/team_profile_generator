**explaining my project**

This was a much larger and more complex assignment than I expected it to be but I did learn a great deal while working through it.

The big thing i want to say up front is at time of submission, it is not quite complete. I just cant get anything to push to my Html file. i have spent alot of time on this one and cant get the final part working so need to submit it uncompleted so i dont fall behind with the future projects. i do wish to complete this though as I think alot of this project would be very useful. 

## Contribution
Sole contributor to this project. No starting code was provided so had to begin the project from scratch. I have created all the files and code seen in my submission. I did do research into the coding syntax and used past class activities as a catalyst to get the project to where it is now

## Test
there are 4 .js test files for each of the classes. typing npm run test to begin this process
