**explaining my project**

This was a much larger and more complex assignment than I expected it to be but I did learn a great deal while working through it.

I had alot of issues and initial submitted an incomplete project. I have now been granted a resubmission and this is the finished project now

## Contribution
Sole contributor to this project. No starting code was provided so had to begin the project from scratch. I have created all the files and code seen in my submission. I did do research into the coding syntax and used past class activities as a catalyst to get the project to where it is now

## Test
there are 4 .js test files for each of the classes. typing npm run test to begin this process
